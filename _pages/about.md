## research interests

Currently, I am working on machine learning systems. 

Before this, I focused on distributed timeseries DBMS and big data storage systems. I am a <b>Committer </b> of <b>[Apache IoTDB](https://iotdb.apache.org/) open source community</b>. From 2021.3-2024.6, I designed, developed and maintained the standalone storage engine and distributed procedures of timeseries metadata for Apache IoTDB.
